# ðŸ“„ CPU Scheduler Simulator

This project is a **Java-based CPU Scheduler Simulator** implementing the following classic scheduling algorithms:

- **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
- **Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ)**
- **Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)**

It reads processes (Process Control Blocks) from user input or a predefined test case and simulates their scheduling while measuring:

- **Average Waiting Time (AWT)**
- **Average Turnaround Time (ATT)**
- **CPU Utilization (%)**
- **Throughput (Processes per second)**
- **Response Time (RT)**

At the end, it outputs a comparison table across all three algorithms.

# âœ¨ Features

- Supports user-defined or auto-generated (50) processes.
- Measures and reports key performance metrics.
- Displays scheduling results clearly in tabular format.
- Pure Java â€” **no external libraries required**.
